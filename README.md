## Overview 
This repository includes solutions for two tasks from **Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python**. The tasks are: 

- **Task 1:** Read a file (`sample.txt`) and handle exceptions if the file does not exist. 
- **Task 2:** Write user input to a file (`output.txt`), append additional data, and display the final content. 

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 

### Description 
This Python program: 
1. Opens and reads a text file named **sample.txt**. 
2. Prints its content line by line. 
3. Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist. 

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File 

### Description 
This Python program: 
1. Takes user input and writes it to a file named **output.txt**. 
2. Appends additional data to the same file. 
3. Reads and displays the final content of the file. 

## Files 
- **A4_Task1.py:** Contains the code for reading a file and handling errors. 
- **A4_Task2.py:** Contains the code for writing, appending, and displaying file content. 

## How to Run  

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in the repository folder.  
4. Run the following commands:  

   - For **Task 1** (Read a file and handle errors):  
     ```bash
     python A4_Task1.py
     ```  
     > Note: Ensure that `sample.txt` is present in the same folder, otherwise the program will display an error message.  

   - For **Task 2** (Write and append data to a file):  
     ```bash
     python A4_Task2.py
     ```  
     > The program will ask for input text to write and append, then display the final file content.
